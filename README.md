Very simple Google Chrome extension that allows to insert **not** cryptographically secure RFC4122 version 4 compliant uuids into currently selected input field on any page. Just press the extension's icon.

Currently used function to generate uuid is not mine, taken from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-a-guid-uuid/2117523#2117523)
